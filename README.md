<h1>Loan Eligibility Prediction Project</h1>

This machine learning project, implemented in Python with scikit-learn, focuses on predicting loan eligibility using a Decision Tree Classifier. The repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the utilization of a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier for loan eligibility predictions on a test dataset. Explore the code to understand the steps involved in building and evaluating the predictive model.
